Project Overview
This section is your elevator pitch.
What it is: A brief, clear description of the agent (e.g., "A Generative AI Agent built on the [Agent Framework, e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, or n8n/workflow builder] that automates [specific task, e.g., email classification and response generation] by connecting [LLM, e.g., Google Gemini] with external tools like Gmail.").
Problem Solved: Explain the pain point it addresses (e.g., "It reduces the time spent on repetitive email tasks, allowing for faster and more consistent customer support.").
Core Technology: List the main components (e.g., Python, Google Gemini API, Gmail Tool).
✨ Features

[Core Function 1]: E.g., Automates email response generation based on sentiment and content.
[Core Function 2]: E.g., Uses an external tool to check the user's calendar/database before responding.
[Core Function 3]: E.g., Includes a human-in-the-loop mechanism for final approval.
[Core Function 4]: E.g., Supports multiple LLM providers via a configurable interface.
